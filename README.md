# Week2
For our week 2 project, we had to create portfolio page that was responsive to different screen sizes. We also had to incorporate various bootstrap component to our webpage. For the first time, we also had to make sure our links were functional and operating. The images on the page has to also be responsive to the various screen sizes. We had to implement the skills that was taught to us this week by using the row and column grid in our webpages. I also added a navbar at the top of my page. After creating the content within my page, I added a personalized picture and information about myself.
